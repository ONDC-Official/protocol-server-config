                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,

                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and

                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                                    recurring event. At a minimum a schedule
                                    will specify frequency which describes the

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the
                                            `search` and achieve more relevant
                                            results. When received during
                                            `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                                            under the heading described by the

                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  Describes the terms of settlement between the
                                  BAP and the BPP for a single transaction. When
                                  instantiated, this object contains <ol><li>the
                                  amount that has to be settled,</li><li>The
                                  payment destination destination

                                  happen, and</li><li>A transaction reference
                                  ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP
                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                    typically sent as the response to a search intent from a

                    supported by the BPP can also be included here. The BPP can
                    show hierarchical nature of products/services in its catalog
                    using the parent_category_id in categories. The BPP can also

                    duration for which a BAP can cache the catalog and use the

                                                BAPs during search to narrow the
                                                `search` and achieve more relevant
                                                results. When received during

                                                  Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                                  extended metadata. This object can be
                                                  added as a property to any schema to
                                                  describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                                  tags can be sent during search to
                                                  optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                                  can use tags to index their catalog to
                                                  allow better search functionality. Tags
                                                  are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                                  catalog response in the `on_search`
                                                  callback. Tags are also meant for
                                                  display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                                  BAPs are meant to render them as
                                                  name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                                  useful when rendering tabular
                                                  information about a product or service.

                                  Describes the direct performer, driver or
                                  executor that fulfills an order. It is usually
                                  a person. But in some rare cases, it could be
                                  a non-living entity like a drone, or a bot.
                                  Some examples of agents are Doctor in the
                                  healthcare sector, a driver in the mobility
                                  sector, or a delivery person in the logistics
                                  sector. This object can be set at any stage of
                                  the order lifecycle. This can be set at the
                                  discovery stage when the BPP wants to provide
                                  details on the agent fulfilling the order,
                                  like in healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                  appears during search. This object can also
                                  used to search for a particular person that
                                  the customer wants fulfilling an order.
                                  Sometimes, this object gets instantiated after
                                  the order is confirmed, like in the case of
                                  on-demand taxis, where the driver is assigned
                                  after the user confirms the ride.

                          During a transaction, the BPP reserves the right to
                          decide the terms of payment. However, the BAP can send
                          its terms to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree
                          to those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return
                          them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP must either
                          agree to the terms sent by the BPP in order to
                          preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the
                          transaction. In case of such disagreements, the BAP
                          and the BPP can perform offline negotiations on the
                          payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the BAP
                          and BPP can resume transactions.

                                          This is typically a Form Input.
                                          Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                          is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                          order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                          ticket, the airline requires details of
                                          the passengers along with information on
                                          baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                          class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                          company may require details on the
                                          nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                          the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                          require additional details on the
                                          applicant in order to confirm a job
                                          application. For all such purposes, the
                                          BPP can choose to send this object
                                          attached to any object in the catalog
                                          that is required to be sent while
                                          placing the order. This object can
                                          typically be sent at an item level or at
                                          the order level. The item level XInput
                                          will override the Order level XInput as
                                          it indicates a special requirement of
                                          information for that particular item.
                                          Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                          form for the Item and another form at
                                          the Order level before confirmation.

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the
                                            `search` and achieve more relevant
                                            results. When received during
                                            `on_search`, BAPs must render this list

                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                      be fulfilled either via store pickup or a
                                      home delivery. Similarly, a medical
                                      consultation can be provided either
                                      in-person or via tele-consultation. The
                                      network policy must publish standard
                                      fulfillment type codes for the different
                                      modes of fulfillment.

                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP
                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the

                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                      home delivery. Similarly, a medical

                                      in-person or via tele-consultation. The

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP
                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            inputs required to confirm an order.
                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    fetched. The content fetched from the

                                                    mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                            sector, the driver may require a

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                        callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are
                        asynchronous, BAPs need a common value to match an
                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages
                        coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                        message_id.

                                            this group. This property can be set by
                                            BAPs during search to narrow the
                                            `search` and achieve more relevant
                                            results. When received during
                                            `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                                            under the heading described by the
                                            `name` property of this schema.

                                              Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and

                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                        callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are
                        asynchronous, BAPs need a common value to match an
                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages
                        coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                        message_id.

                                            properties can be overriden by

                                            As this schema is purely for catalog

                                            to send this value during search.

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the
                                            `search` and achieve more relevant
                                            results. When received during
                                            `on_search`, BAPs must render this list
                                            under the heading described by the

                                              Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                      home delivery. Similarly, a medical

                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and

                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages

                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                                BAPs during search to narrow the

                                                  extended metadata. This object can be
                                                  added as a property to any schema to
                                                  describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                                  tags can be sent during search to
                                                  optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                                  can use tags to index their catalog to
                                                  allow better search functionality. Tags
                                                  are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                                  catalog response in the `on_search`
                                                  callback. Tags are also meant for
                                                  display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                                  BAPs are meant to render them as
                                                  name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                                  useful when rendering tabular
                                                  information about a product or service.

                                              appears during search. This object can
                                              also used to search for a particular
                                              person that the customer wants
                                              fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                              object gets instantiated after the order
                                              is confirmed, like in the case of
                                              on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                              assigned after the user confirms the
                                              ride.

                                      reference ID</li></ol>. During a
                                      transaction, the BPP reserves the right to
                                      decide the terms of payment. However, the
                                      BAP can send its terms to the BPP first.
                                      If the BPP does not agree to those terms,
                                      it must overwrite the terms and return
                                      them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                      must either agree to the terms sent by the
                                      BPP in order to preserve the provider's
                                      autonomy, or abort the transaction. In
                                      case of such disagreements, the BAP and
                                      the BPP can perform offline negotiations
                                      on the payment terms. Once an agreement is
                                      reached, the BAP and BPP can resume
                                      transactions.

                                                inputs required to confirm an order.
                                                This is typically a Form Input.
                                                Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                                is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                                order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                                ticket, the airline requires details of
                                                the passengers along with information on
                                                baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                                class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                                company may require details on the
                                                nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                                the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                                require additional details on the
                                                applicant in order to confirm a job
                                                application. For all such purposes, the
                                                BPP can choose to send this object
                                                attached to any object in the catalog
                                                that is required to be sent while
                                                placing the order. This object can
                                                typically be sent at an item level or at
                                                the order level. The item level XInput
                                                will override the Order level XInput as
                                                it indicates a special requirement of
                                                information for that particular item.
                                                Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                                form for the Item and another form at
                                                the Order level before confirmation.

                                                        fetched, the rendering platform can

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and

                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol

                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                        callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are
                        asynchronous, BAPs need a common value to match an
                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages
                        coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                        message_id.

                                            then the group will not be displayed. If
                                            it is set to true, it should be
                                            displayed. However, group-level display
                                            properties can be overriden by
                                            individual tag-level display property.
                                            As this schema is purely for catalog

                                            to send this value during search.

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the

                                            `on_search`, BAPs must render this list

                                              Describes a tag. This is used to contain
                                              extended metadata. This object can be
                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                      home delivery. Similarly, a medical

                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol

                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages
                        coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                        message_id.

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.

                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the

                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and
                    `region`.</li><li>Addressing details like the sending and
                    receiving platform's ID and API
                    URL.</li><li>Interoperability information like the protocol
                    version that implemented by the sender
                    and,</li><li>Transaction details like the method being
                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S
                    implementations, it is not necessary to send the context
                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        requests. The BPPs can use this value to push
                        personalized recommendations, and dynamic offerings
                        related to an ongoing transaction despite being unaware

                        This is a unique value which persists during a request /
                        callback cycle. Since beckn protocol APIs are
                        asynchronous, BAPs need a common value to match an
                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This
                        value can also be used to ignore duplicate messages
                        coming from the BPP. It is recommended to generate a
                        fresh message_id for every new interaction. When sending
                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new
                        message_id.

                    Every API call in beckn protocol has a context. It provides
                    a high-level overview to the receiver about the nature of
                    the intended transaction. Typically, it is the BAP that sets
                    the transaction context based on the consumer's location and
                    action on their UI. But sometimes, during unsolicited
                    callbacks, the BPP also sets the transaction context but it
                    is usually the same as the context of a previous full-cycle,
                    request-callback interaction between the BAP and the BPP.
                    The context object contains four types of fields.
                    <ol><li>Demographic information about the transaction using
                    fields like `domain`, `country`, and

                    version that implemented by the sender

                    called at the receiver's endpoint, the transaction_id that
                    represents an end-to-end user session at the BAP, a message
                    ID to pair requests with callbacks, a timestamp to capture
                    sending times, a ttl to specifiy the validity of the
                    request, and a key to encrypt information if
                    necessary.</li></ol> This object must be passed in every
                    interaction between a BAP and a BPP. In HTTP/S

                    during the synchronous response. However, in asynchronous
                    protocols, the context must be sent during all interactions,

                        incoming callback from a BPP to an earlier call. This

                        unsolicited callbacks, BPPs must generate a new

                                            BAPs during search to narrow the

                                              added as a property to any schema to
                                              describe extended attributes. For BAPs,
                                              tags can be sent during search to
                                              optimize and filter search results. BPPs
                                              can use tags to index their catalog to
                                              allow better search functionality. Tags
                                              are sent by the BPP as part of the
                                              catalog response in the `on_search`
                                              callback. Tags are also meant for
                                              display purposes. Upon receiving a tag,
                                              BAPs are meant to render them as
                                              name-value pairs. This is particularly
                                              useful when rendering tabular
                                              information about a product or service.

                                      home delivery. Similarly, a medical

                                  agent:

                                      The agent that is currently handling the
                                      fulfillment of the order

                                          Describes the direct performer, driver
                                          or executor that fulfills an order. It
                                          is usually a person. But in some rare
                                          cases, it could be a non-living entity
                                          like a drone, or a bot. Some examples of
                                          agents are Doctor in the healthcare
                                          sector, a driver in the mobility sector,
                                          or a delivery person in the logistics
                                          sector. This object can be set at any
                                          stage of the order lifecycle. This can
                                          be set at the discovery stage when the
                                          BPP wants to provide details on the
                                          agent fulfilling the order, like in
                                          healthcare, where the doctor's name
                                          appears during search. This object can
                                          also used to search for a particular
                                          person that the customer wants
                                          fulfilling an order. Sometimes, this
                                          object gets instantiated after the order
                                          is confirmed, like in the case of
                                          on-demand taxis, where the driver is
                                          assigned after the user confirms the
                                          ride.

                                  ID</li></ol>. During a transaction, the BPP
                                  reserves the right to decide the terms of
                                  payment. However, the BAP can send its terms
                                  to the BPP first. If the BPP does not agree to
                                  those terms, it must overwrite the terms and
                                  return them to the BAP. If overridden, the BAP
                                  must either agree to the terms sent by the BPP
                                  in order to preserve the provider's autonomy,
                                  or abort the transaction. In case of such
                                  disagreements, the BAP and the BPP can perform
                                  offline negotiations on the payment terms.
                                  Once an agreement is reached, the BAP and BPP
                                  can resume transactions.

                                            inputs required to confirm an order.
                                            This is typically a Form Input.
                                            Sometimes, selection of catalog elements
                                            is not enough for the BPP to confirm an
                                            order. For example, to confirm a flight
                                            ticket, the airline requires details of
                                            the passengers along with information on
                                            baggage, identity, in addition to the
                                            class of ticket. Similarly, a logistics
                                            company may require details on the
                                            nature of shipment in order to confirm
                                            the shipping. A recruiting firm may
                                            require additional details on the
                                            applicant in order to confirm a job
                                            application. For all such purposes, the
                                            BPP can choose to send this object
                                            attached to any object in the catalog
                                            that is required to be sent while
                                            placing the order. This object can
                                            typically be sent at an item level or at
                                            the order level. The item level XInput
                                            will override the Order level XInput as
                                            it indicates a special requirement of
                                            information for that particular item.
                                            Hence the BAP must render a separate
                                            form for the Item and another form at
                                            the Order level before confirmation.

                                                    mime_type specified in this object. Once
                                                    fetched, the rendering platform can
                                                    choosed to render the form as-is as an
